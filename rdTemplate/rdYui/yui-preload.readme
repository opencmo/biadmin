YUI Preload is based off concepts from Simple YUI(http://ericmiraglia.com/yui/demos/quickyui.php)

We want quick and easy access to cross-browser javascript utilities.  Therefore we built a prepackaged YUI
instance with several modules already preloaded and made them available in the global space.

Refer to README in ThirdParty/YUI-Preload repos for more information
